Social Networking Platform
--------------------

This codebase represents the core functionality of a **Social Networking Platform** designed to provide an intuitive user experience while maintaining scalability and security. The backend, built with Node.js and Express, manages data through MongoDB, ensuring efficient and reliable storage of user profiles, posts, messages, and friendships. It uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication and bcrypt for password encryption, making sure user credentials are protected. Real-time communication is enabled through WebSockets, supporting instant messaging between users.

On the frontend, the application is built with React and Redux, allowing for responsive, interactive, and efficient data handling across the application. The interface is styled using TailwindCSS, ensuring a modern look and feel with minimal effort. The project structure is modular, with well-organized directories for API routes, models, components, and utilities, making it easy to expand and maintain.

To ensure flexibility, the code includes environment variable configuration, allowing different settings for development and production. The README provides step-by-step setup instructions, allowing anyone to quickly set up the project locally, and the contribution guidelines encourage open-source collaboration.
