Social Networking Project

This is a simple social networking project implemented in C, designed to model and analyze connections between users. It uses graph structures to represent the relationships in the network, allowing for efficient handling of user connections, friend suggestions, and other common social network features.

Features

User Profiles: Basic information is stored for each user in the network.

Connections: Users can form connections or friendships, represented as edges in a graph.

Graph Structure: The network is structured as a graph where each node is a user, and edges indicate friendships or connections.

Basic Operations:

Adding and removing users.

Forming and breaking connections.

Displaying connections of a user.

Finding mutual connections or friends.



Technologies Used

Language: C

Data Structure: Graphs (Adjacency Matrix/List)
